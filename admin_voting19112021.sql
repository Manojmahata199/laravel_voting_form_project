My first job after that was as a lead designer with an Ahmedabad-based firm that designed Christmas décor. However, I let it go when I married into a business family from Kolkata. My family in Kolkata owns a cosmetic manufacturing company. With their help, I got the opportunity to not only take my family’s legacy forward, but turn it into my own.

There is no short cut for success. Success achieved through short cuts is never satisfying, nor is it permanent. One has to work hard to be successful, keep learning while doing so, and keep adapting.\r\n\r\n4.	Honesty and integrity, together with resilience are the cornerstone of success.

Self-introspect, be self-aware and you will be shown the right path at the right time.', 'Choosing an unusual career; stock and commodity broking, in the late eighties/early nineties, which were traditionally exclusive male bastions, was bound to be challenging.\r\n\r\n I was fully aware of an unwelcome entry, and a nebulous and arduous journey ahead, but I was confident that with patience, skills, honesty, integrity and dedication, I will achieve my goal.\r\n\r\n Initially, the biggest challenge that I faced was acceptability. People were not used to dealing with a woman stock broker and they thought that being a woman, I had ventured into this field as a non- serious player. Due to ignorance and ill information, being skeptical, about dealing with a woman stock broker, many potential clients, initially, even refused meeting me.\r\n\r\n I had a very rough journey initially, building my company virtually brick by brick, person to person, only by word of mouth publicity.\r\n\r\n Apart from professional challenges, I also faced repeated nerve shattering personal tragedies and traumas, including losing my son (only child) to a life threatening disease. \r\n\r\nAmong the four persons comprising my parents and in laws, three suffered from cancer. My father in law was run over by a bus and was on the verge of losing one leg. But these were small difficulties compared to what I had to face with my young son (at that time only child). He was diagnosed with a congenital life threatening condition, and despite my best efforts, I lost him.\r\n\r\n These personal challenges were far more heartbreaking that the professional ones faced by me .God chose me to undergo these personal challenges. I could not overcome them. Professional challenges were man created and therefore much easier to overcome. I knew I will be able to overcome them easily. With blessings from my mentor Gurudev Sri Sri Ravishankar,I have now accepted and reconciled to everything.', 'I was a pioneer; being one of the very few women stock and commodity brokers when I began my career.\r\n\r\nThrough, patience, hard work, integrity and honesty and above all the support of my family and the blessings of God and my spiritual Guru Sri Sri Ravishankar, I proved myself to be successful in a male dominated field. This broke the taboo that stock, share and commodity broking, which hitherto were “men only “occupations, could easily be breached by women.\r\n\r\n The very same men who were very unwelcoming to me during the initial stages of my career; thinking of me and treating me as an intruder, were the same people who subsequently applauded my work and decorated me richly with awards, honors and recognition. \r\n\r\nThis paved the way for many women in the society who may have been keen at that time to join this profession, but were unsure of doing so, to ultimately see, hear, read or come to know about me, and that encouraged them to traverse the path laid down by me.\r\n\r\nToday, I am delighted to see so many women making a successful career in this field.\r\n\r\n Among the thousands of my clients, I had hundreds of housewives too, who had no knowledge or exposure or treating stock, shares and commodities as an alternative investment avenue to generate wealth. I literally taught them from scratch, and was ultimately able to make them confident enough to use these instruments for wealth generation. This large pool of housewives in turn reached out to an ever larger pool of hesitant women, and like compound interest, this exponentially grew. So while we hear of initiatives like Millennium Moms now a days, (which is no doubt doing a good job), I had stated this initiative, albeit, silently a full decade earlier.', 'I quit as MD of my company in 2011, and left the profession of stock and commodity broking,as I wanted to listen to my inner calling and get associated with a charitable cause.\r\n\r\n By then my company was at its zenith, generating a turnover of nearly 4000 crores, thousands of clients, including some of the leading multinational companies, trading terminals, wide recognition, honors awards etc. \r\n\r\nBut this was never my actual intent. From the very beginning, I had entered the field of stock and commodity broking, not only with an intent or any strong desire for earning a monetary gain, but more so to take it up as a challenge to prove to myself and the world that women can be as successful as men in uncharted territories or professions which are generally not taken up by them.\r\n\r\n This was my motivation and my inspiration for keeping on going despite all the hardships that I faced. Having achieved almost everything that I possibly could,as a woman stock and commodity broker by 2011, I saw no further possibility of personal growth, so I quit,as I wanted to live a life not merely of success, but that of significance.\r\n\r\n From early child hood I had this burning desire to be associated with a charitable cause. I was fortunate to be offered a platform by Gurudev Shri Shri Ravishankar. Any further plans in future will only be in these fields. I set up the finance department of the school which I am looking after as the CFO, and have nurtured it as my child. Once my role over here is over, I will do whatever the organization under the overall supervision of Gurudev decide for me.

As a Msc student in UCL, London, I had not foreseen that my dissertation in the decentralization of maternal health systems will ignite a learning and eventually transform my career path into Maternity Wellness Coaching. We all come into this world through a mother figure and that is the most banal yet challenging reality of life wherein there is a lack of training and ability. I see my contribution in the space of health as two pronged in the last decade: Maternity Wellness and Health Transformation. One specialization leads to the other. In the last decade, I can confidently claim to be a pioneer in breastfeeding education, support and counseling in the entire West Bengal state. If there is a gynecologist committed to lactation support, then he or she knows of me and my contribution to this field through private and public sector trainings. Childbirth was devastating and truly enlightening at the same time. Certifications is Clinical Lactation, Breastfeeding Education, Counseling, Child Nutrition, Pediatric Oral Care, Craniosacral Healing, Sound Healing, Ayurvedic Health, Health Transformation Coaching are all the feathers in my cap as trainings and courses undergone in a decade post becoming a mother. The mothers I have coached have influenced my decision to further coach and transform the health of all adults and children towards the goals of hormonal balance, weight management and disease reversal. Their faith and trust in my knowledge, counseling abilities and ability to adapt and learn have led me to qualify in all the above fields of work as a uniquely well rounded health professional.', 'A health professional is by definition not a medical professional but the patient oftentimes doesn’t see the difference and wants you to be their doctor. As a health and maternity wellness coach, I have used food and counseling techniques to often cure many ailments. But, this has organically challenged many doctors, gynecologists and pediatric opinions. There is no holy grail when it comes to curing human ailments. A 20 something health professional is too young to have any deep rooted knowledge, experience or even be irreverent towards any doctor. A decade ago, the stalwarts of the profession viewed me as irreverent and nothing but a glamour doll overcoming boredom from household chores. Women oftentimes are perceived in a particular way culturally. I learnt to never refute, rebut or waste time on challenging opinions. As I helped, cured and transformed the health of babies, mothers, families, it took the first five years to recognize the need for a lactation and nutrition educator for maternity. Soon it followed the nods of acknowledgement, approval and greetings from the above mentioned fraternity. Finally, a decade into this space, my same desire to assist people, my ability to be fit and presentable is viewed with admiration and respect. A senior doctor once said that without their promotion I will fizzle out within months. Today he is one of the many who has amicably dissolved this view and understood the serious, diligent yet ever improving work that I do. Dr. Santosh Agarwal (renowned pediatrician) congratulated me. He mentioned an infant who was hospitalized and in spite of all the tests they were unable to resolve the issue.  Invariably the rested and happy mother came back to his clinic post resolution. He was pleasantly surprised that she had undergone nutritional counseling with me.', 'There are three clear areas of my social impact in the last 11 years: lactation support, infant feeding, and health transformation. Medical professionals and maternity clients alike know what a lactation and maternity wellness specialist is and the need for one. Many gynecologists and pediatricians now actively have a lactation specialist, nutritionist and counselor on their team to guide mothers. This is a change I have engendered working relentlessly with mothers as there was a huge gap in breastfeeding information and awareness, and the need for mental health counseling postpartum. Postnatal blues and depression is a common mental health distress faced by new moms and in many cases it can destroy the childbirth experience for the entire family. Mothers need constant handholding and support which my postnatal program provides by combining nutrition, mental health counseling and lactation support. I am the pioneer in Kolkata for this combined Maternity Wellness Program and can now say that very few practitioners in India have created such a program. \r\nInfant weaning is a time that brings many challenges, questions and anxieties in mothers. My Infant Wellness Program offers customized solutions to weaning, bridging the gap between traditional weaning and modern baby led weaning techniques. This is the only such comprehensive weaning, developmental milestone and maternal counseling support available in the city.\r\nAs a Health Transformation Coach, a unique blend of Ayurvedic nutrition, mindfulness practices, and healing have transformed client behaviors, hormonal imbalances and diseases in a permanent way. My holistic approach is practically non-existent in India as most practitioners are either just a nutritionist, or healers or counselors. This combination is my offering to transform lives.', 'Books and food are a great combination for outreach and expansion. My latest offering is a book: Growing up with Superfoods. I am co authoring the book with a food writer and restaurateur focused on infant and child nutrition. This book aims to be complete with age based meal plans, recipes for the Indian palette. We are including nutritional content in over 80 recipe offerings. We hope to make it a fun yet informative resource with the USP of bar codes linking to short videos for each recipe.\r\nIn the maternity wellness arena, I have partnered with California based company, The Stroller Club, to bring forth classes on the global platform. The first step is blending Ayurveda hacks for a calm and sickness free pregnancy, Bharatnatyam steps for body balance, and sound vibrational therapy to stay anxiety free while you are expecting. We plan to expand the online tutorial mode and offer specialized classes for a global audience incorporating my varied knowledge bank.', 'Prevention is better than cure. Plant based nutrition can reverse Cancer and Diabetes. Most diseases have a psychosomatic origin in the human brain tied to subconscious and genetic information. I offer a health transformation practice that investigates the subconscious patterns of self sabotaging behavior. This is a holistic approach to reversing disease. Stress has become fashionable and so has having a nightlife. Hormonal imbalance and obesity is on the rise. We follow the biological clock when we sleep on time and wake up early. We respect nature when we are on a plant based diet. We do no self harm nor do we comfort eat if we forgive and embrace everyone in our lives.

Finding the right mix of people in your team is the key. We have experts dealing with all the creative needs for the completion of a project. Our team is well-equipped to take care of your requirements.\r\nClients can be very demanding at times. Be it completing your project at a lesser time, or asking for personalised designs and products, and of course constraining the budget We are proud to be associated with creative geniuses – the craftsmen and artisans of our country, who excel in producing different handcrafted furniture. Needless to say, we ensure that the quality and design are as per the client expectations and within their budget. \r\nIt becomes very difficult to find the right people for the right kind of job especially when it comes to making customised interior design. Here again, our artists are the key for successful completion of your project.', 'The interior design field has embraced a role in improving the lives of people - locally, nationally, and globally. There are several challenges that make interior design an activity developed by professionals in the field. Basically, it is a way to transform the lives of people who live or enjoy a certain space, improving their quality of life in this through design and decoration. Our work is meant to improve quality of life. Our surroundings have an enormous impact on the way we behave and feel, and our role is more important than ever as we retreat to our homes during COVID-19. As a designer we resolve the functionality of a space and address scale, curate a desirable aesthetic, inject soul and tell a story for the inhabitants as well as effecting productivity. We evoke happiness and soothe the soul. It can inspire confidence, empathy, pride, creativity, security and energy. Creating a meaningful space that fulfils the needs of the inhabitant and optimizes their space is one of our key roles as designers and is essential to our society. It’s not about whether the walls are painted in the latest colours, but rather whether the space evokes the desired emotions in the user. I think that it is essential in order to create a sense of well-being in the home, to put together interiors where one can find oneself again and to create suitable spaces. The therapeutic role of interior architecture consists in creating well-being while representing the client’s ideas in material form. If this is done well, the clients are very happy because they recognize themselves in the interior architect’s work. We do everything we can to create the client’s universe, and this is a form of therapy.', 'I plan to provide designers with efficiencies that help them do more designing rather than the operations, communications, tracking, order management, and other stuff that has historically made up 75 percent of their job.\r\nOnce reserved largely for the wealthy, interior design services are gradually becoming available to almost everyone, A trend that will strengthen in the years ahead. Your budget won\'t determine whether you can have a home you like or not. There will be a solution for everyone, at every budget category.\r\nI wish to use fewer resources, the ability to complete the projects efficiently and smoothly, sometimes ahead of time, allows us to explore creative options to go the extra mile. Hence, the smooth collaboration, quick feedback, and holistic oversight will help us to soar to take our projects to new creative heights.\r\nFurthermore, will like to study, research and incorporate the sustainable way of designing, minimizing the harmful affects of construction material on human health and environment.', 'I like to boast that from the past 17 years of my career have been heading an all women team.

The races at the National Level took place on a 200m banked tracks which are elliptical tracks sloped at the turns. There is not a single such track in West Bengal because of which we had to practise on road and that made it really difficult for us to compete with our competitors from different states who would have year round practise on banked tracks. Also due to heavy traffic in the city we had to start practise on the road as early as 4am because later a lot of cars kept coming on the roads which made it very dangerous to skate there. \r\n\r\nI overcame this challenge by travelling to various states for practising on banked track. I would attend camps conducted by some of India\'s best skaters to understand how to use the banked track.

Each and every teaching assignment for me has been also a learning moment for me as the communication with the students has to be improved and developed not only to bring clarity to the teaching content but also to reach out the students coming from diverse backgrounds. I realized, sooner than later, that teacher is a learner as every class is a fresh challenge. However, the sense of being awarded comes when I learn that my students have received the recognition they deserve.\r\nEach and every curatorial project too has been a learning experience for me as well. Usually there is no prototype to follow since each curatorial project, independent or commissioned, requires a fresh start. However, when a curated exhibition reaches the stage where the show assumes a meaningful status and is able to reach many viewers, I feel a sense of achievement. Especially when my curated show receives critical acclaim, good media review and also makes it commercially viable, I feel that is one of the key achievements in my career.', 'One of the biggest challenges I have faced in my career when I ventured to curate shows with young and unknown artists. It is extremely challenging to select the most suitable artists, for a particular curated show, and situate them in the proper context and promote them in order to bring in fresh ideas and works in the art world. The art world generally is comfortable with the well-known and saleable names. Therefore, to justify the new and unknown artists and make their works saleable is a tough call. However, once the selection is done and the show is conceptualized well, then the promotional talk shows, pre-opening press release and a firm conviction leads me to overcome the challenge.', 'My curatorial projects have, I believe, are creating a visible impact on the art community and also on the society. Because I have done some successful art exhibitions showcasing the young and upcoming artists and because the art viewing public has shown great interest in such shows, the younger generation of artists are feeling enthused and encouraged to continue their engagement with their art practice with a renewed energy and hope.

This, however, did not daunt us. I knew that we at Akshar were doing the correct thing. I knew that the recipients of the benefit of an inclusive school would not only be confined to those children with special needs, but also for mainstream children. Children would learn from the lesser-abled, and observe how they strive to achieve their goals despite limitations. They would grow up to be sensitive young children with sound humane values. \r\n\r\nThe challenge for Akshar at the outset was getting parents of the Mainstream children to admit their child. Some questioned the concept and wondered whether their child\'s education would be compromised. We started with a total of 70 children till class II. Today we are a full grown I.S.C school with cent percent achievers. \r\n\r\nThe victory today is that a lot more parents of mainstream children would like to admit their children to Akshar because of the values inculcated in their children in an inclusive environment. Akshar conducts workshops on Inclusion and Education for All, at the outset of every academic year, for parents. \r\n\r\nWe must praise our teachers. It is their sheer motivation to learn more that keeps them closely affiliated with Akshar and its success. Workshops like Quality Circle Time conducted by Jenny Mosley, Global Trends and Best Practices in Education by Scholastic India, Workshop on Theatre Education in School conducted by The American Centre, Dyslexia - D.A.R.E to Win, a conference organised by Breaking through Dyslexia, to name a few, have worked extremely well in skill upgradation for our teachers.', 'The first step towards bringing about significant change in society is by building awareness. This can only be done by leading by example.

At that time the organization was new and had no resources to contemplate an institutional model also. At that point I had only two paths ahead of me. I could close the organization which was only 10 month old and pursue my professional career in corporate sector. Or I could plunge into the problem and find my way despite all the challenges. I decided to take the latter path. The rest is history.', '• Iswar Sankalpa has been working towards the protection of the rights of persons with psychosocial disabilities (primarily the homeless and slum-based population) since 2007– upholding their right to health services, right to comprehensive habilitation/rehabilitation, their right to employment, their right to safe housing and their right to access government facilities, entitlements and other benefits, by setting up a continuum of multi-pronged care and support. It has been striving to build a model of inclusive care for the most vulnerable and least legally protected population by designing and redesigning programmes and strategies based on their emerging needs. A combination of services (outreach, shelter, day care centre, clinic-based, community centred…) and reintegration support programmes (skills training, non-formal education, access to entitlements, community living, income generation programmes, selfadvocacy…) have been developed over the years since no one size fits all and no particular solution is the only solution to the complexities and the magnitude of the problem in hand. The work being rooted in the Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) model is addressing 5 major aspects of living: Health, Education, Livelihood, Social and Empowerment. With the target group’s choice, agency and participation forming the nucleus of the work, the model underlines the importance of multi-sectoral collaboration (family of the primary stakeholders, law enforcement agency, government, medical body, community, civil society and media) for facilitating sustainable community reintegration of the vulnerable social groups. \r\n•	3440 homeless persons with psychosocial disability, living on the streets, have been provided treatment & services through community based care model\r\n•	604 women have been provided a safe shelter.\r\n•	129 men have been provided a safe shelter.\r\n•	468 persons have been restored to home across India\r\n•	775 persons with psychosocial disability are in employment\r\n•	716 persons have been provided vocational training\r\n•	120 persons have received ration card, 176 persons have received disability card, 264 persons have received adhar card and 171 persons have their own bank account.\r\n•	4633  persons from low income group families have been provided treatment, counseling & CBR support through Urban Mental Health Clinics\r\n•	895 awareness campaigns were conducted in the community for sensitization and education covering more than 51935 people\r\n•	288 health workers, medical officers and police personnel have been provided mental health training\r\n•	A network of 476 CBOs has been created to provide various support\r\n•	2 mental health committees have been formed involving local councillors, community leaders and community members', 'I would like to work to offer opportunities for our men/ women to be financially independent.

At that time I was left completely broken - financially, emotionally and also totally lost in the pursuit of how to manage this wholly unknown social problem - the homeless person with severe mental illness. At that time the organization was new and had no resources to contemplate an institutional model also. At that point I had only two paths ahead of me. I could close the organization which was only 10 month old and pursue my professional career in corporate sector. Or I could plunge into the problem and find my way despite all the challenges. I decided to take the latter path. The rest is history.', '• Iswar Sankalpa has been working towards the protection of the rights of persons with psychosocial disabilities (primarily the homeless and slum-based population) since 2007– upholding their right to health services, right to comprehensive habilitation/rehabilitation, their right to employment, their right to safe housing and their right to access government facilities, entitlements and other benefits, by setting up a continuum of multi-pronged care and support. It has been striving to build a model of inclusive care for the most vulnerable and least legally protected population by designing and redesigning programmes and strategies based on their emerging needs. A combination of services (outreach, shelter, day care centre, clinic-based, community centred…) and reintegration support programmes (skills training, non-formal education, access to entitlements, community living, income generation programmes, selfadvocacy…) have been developed over the years since no one size fits all and no particular solution is the only solution to the complexities and the magnitude of the problem in hand. The work being rooted in the Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) model is addressing 5 major aspects of living: Health, Education, Livelihood, Social and Empowerment. With the target group’s choice, agency and participation forming the nucleus of the work, the model underlines the importance of multi-sectoral collaboration (family of the primary stakeholders, law enforcement agency, government, medical body, community, civil society and media) for facilitating sustainable community reintegration of the vulnerable social groups. \r\n•	3440 homeless persons with psychosocial disability, living on the streets, have been provided treatment & services through community based care model\r\n•	604 women have been provided a safe shelter.\r\n•	129 men have been provided a safe shelter.\r\n•	468 persons have been restored to home across India\r\n•	775 persons with psychosocial disability are in employment\r\n•	716 persons have been provided vocational training\r\n•	120 persons have received ration card, 176 persons have received disability card, 264 persons have received adhar card and 171 persons have their own bank account.\r\n•	4633  persons from low income group families have been provided treatment, counseling & CBR support through Urban Mental Health Clinics\r\n•	895 awareness campaigns were conducted in the community for sensitization and education covering more than 51935 people\r\n•	288 health workers, medical officers and police personnel have been provided mental health training\r\n•	A network of 476 CBOs has been created to provide various support\r\n•	2 mental health committees have been formed involving local councillors, community leaders and community members', 'I would like to work to offer opportunities for our men/ women to be financially independent. I hope to have small kiosks/ shops in parts of the city where products made by persons with psychosocial disability are bought, used and recommended for their worth and not for sympathy.

Learning dance at a very tender age gave me immense happiness then and later paved the way for a career in it.\r\n\r\nI always knew that I wanted to live with an art form. I also knew that I would do whatever it takes to train myself to become an independent artist with an individualistic approach to my chosen art form.  \r\n\r\nThat desire started taking shape when I joined my guru Sharmila Biswas years ago.\r\n\r\nI was intrigued by her approach towards Odishi and the vast body of work. I took things very slowly to understand every bit of the training, the research, the intricacies, and the volume of the process. \r\n\r\nMy dance career just flowed through these processes. And what I most enjoyed is the freedom within the hardcore professional life of an artiste.\r\n\r\nA very early start to my solo career gave me the necessary experience and confidence to start my own dance institute. My Institute ‘Angashuddhi – Home for Odishi’ is an initiative to nurture, and pass on the experience of learning Odishi dance to the next generation. I strive to encourage the appreciation of the Odishi dance form and imbibe its roots to dancers and art enthusiasts alike. \r\n\r\nI am very content as a dancer, and Odishi is my language of expression.
